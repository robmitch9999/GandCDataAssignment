# GandCDataAssignment
Contains my submissions for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course assignment.

My assignment response includes the following:

1) run_analysis.R

     this is the script that does all the transformation between the raw (unzipped) data
     and the final summary dataset presented as newData.txt
     your working directory must be the top level directory of the unzipped data "UCI HAR Dataset"
  
2) README.md

     this file!
  
3) codeBook.md

     contains all the explanatory details.
  
4) newData.txt

     text file containing the summary neat data produced by the script run_analysis.R
